# _Setting up an Aquarium_

 ###### *1) What was it that I did?* 

I recently set up a planted aquarium that has shrimp, snails and a couple fish living in it. 

###### *2) When did I do it?* 

I began working on the project around 3months ago.

###### *3) What was good about it?* 

It's a relaxing experience building the tank and observing the animals afterwards too.

###### *4) What was my favorite memory of it?* 

Thankfully I managed to create a healthy aquarium so I see the animals showing a lot of behaviors. It's like watching a mini nature documentary. 

###### *5) What didn't I enjoy about it?* 

I didn't really have anu bad experiences, it was something I did slowly on my own time so the experience as a whole has been relaxing.

###### *6) Grading my experience.*
