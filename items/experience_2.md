# _Landscaping for a Summer_

 ###### *1) What was it that I did?* 

The company did either contracted lawn-care or landscaping on homes. I went back and forth in between and learned some things like interlocking.

###### *2) When did I do it?* 

I did it in the summer after my 10th grade in highschool.

###### *3) What was good about it?* 

I learned a whole lot and got to see parts of my neighborhood I haven't seen. 

###### *4) What was my favorite memory of it?* 

Learning and using machinery during landscaping was cool, seeing the progress of landscaping overtime was also something I enjoyed.

###### *5) What didn't I enjoy about it?* 

The work was physically though so I didn't have much energy to put into sports like I would usually in the summer.

###### *6) Grading my experience.*
