# _Landscaping at Home_

 ###### *1) What was it that I did?* 

I laid down some stone in the backyard of my house .

###### *2) When did I do it?* 

I did it right before moving to Brantford for school during August.

###### *3) What was good about it?* 

It was something my family's wanted to do for a while so it was nice to see the plans put in place.

###### *4) What was my favorite memory of it?* 

I was pretty unsure how it would turn out and if it'd be stable, but with patience we managed to make it work very well and at a very low cost. I learned a lot during the process too, because there was so much problem solving involved.

###### *5) What didn't I enjoy about it?* 

There wasn't anything bad about it, it was just  physically taxing so I was more tired while it was being built.

###### *6) Grading my experience.*
