 ###### *1) What was it that I did?* 

The work varied when it came to my responsibilities and locations. For example, I had one location where I monitored a construction site and another where I was at a concert.

###### *2) When did I do it?* 

I did it for a year right up until this fall when school started. 

###### *3) What was good about it?* 

I learned a lot not only in security but other fields because I'd be working at different sites and meeting different people.

###### *4) What was my favorite memory of it?* 

Outdoor sites were fun for me because I worked during COVID and getting to be outside like in a park meant I got to relax a bit too.

###### *5) What didn't I enjoy about it?* 

The system meant for logging hours, choosing shifts... wasn't great and kept changing meaning the apps and other services didn't always work. It was unnecessarily complicated and made work for everyone more difficult.

###### *6) Grading my experience.*
