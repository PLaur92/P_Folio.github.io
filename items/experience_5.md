# _Fishing_

 ###### *1) What was it that I did?* 

I just recently got into fishing again, the last time I fished was when I was in elementary school.

###### *2) When did I do it?* 

I started this fall once I moved to Brantford, the Grand River feeds into lake Erie and has a lot of fish moving through it.

###### *3) What was good about it?* 

Learning how to use the rod, different rigging techniques... has been very fun and I also get to see a whole lot of wildlife during fishing, like toads, deer, birds, etc.

###### *4) What was my favorite memory of it?* 


Getting to explore and going along the river has been rally fun, it changes so much and I'm not used to seeing so much wildlife so it's been a learning experience seeing different animals.


###### *5) What didn't I enjoy about it?* 


Nothing bad about it.


###### *6) Grading my experience.*
